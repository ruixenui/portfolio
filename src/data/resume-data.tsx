  summary:
    "AI Software Engineer at OpenCV, focused on building intelligent systems that blend computer vision and language understanding. I work at the intersection of models and deployment — from prototyping novel architectures to shipping production-ready AI tools. With a strong interest in agentic workflows, cloud infrastructure, and scalable inference, I'm driven by the challenge of bringing real-world AI applications to life. I’m also an active supporter of open-source AI, contributing to tools that lower the barrier to innovation.",
